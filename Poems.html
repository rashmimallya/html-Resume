<h1>MY POEMS</h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>SKY</b>
    <pre>        You, blue and beautiful shine in my eyes
        Here I come to you for peace, the sky
        
        Seeing you every day is just so amazing
        I want to fly give me some wings
        
        You just soak in all the  H2O
        Like cotton candy, u just  float
        
        When u can't hold up u rain
        Just like I do when I m in pain
        
        Sometimes u shine up like morning snow
        Just like the happiness that makes me glow
        
        Somedays go bad with dark clouds around
        It makes me feel like losing the ground
        
        The rain pours in with thunders and lights
        Just like wave of emotions that i fight
        
        End of the rain is a beautiful rainbow
        Just a reminder for me to grow
        
        With the smell of fresh soil, the sky clears up
        After a bad day, it all cheers me up
        
        In this puddle of overthinking, I sink
        Then comes a storm of thoughts to think
        
        Yet I see the sky bright, shining in the daylight
        For all that I forget after seeing this peaceful sight</pre></li>

        <li><b>CHOICE</b>
        <pre>            Falling in love is just so easy
            Its just like work done for lazy
            Entering in love is just so wow
            It's just the beginning for the shoutout
            
            The steps are still not done
            Its a long way for u to run
            Its the choice of the destiny
            That togetherness is huge or tiny
            
            Faith and trust are its pillars
            Are usually shaken by liars
            Its ur testing time my buddy
            Getting all tht shit done is so funny
            
            Being together is the matter
            And tht will take it further
            If it's all done right it's amazing
            Otherwise it's scenery not of ur settings
            
            Whatever may be written future
            Focus on ur wat u nurture
            Don't focus on the beauty in market
            Let the inner beauty be ur target
            
            People show up wat u wanna see
            Try to capture their real me
            Because stones can seen by a lay man
            But diamonds come up by removing the tan
            
            The end is not the end always
            It is the beginning of new ways
            Believing in u is the reality
            Rest all might just be an imaginary!!!!!!</pre></li>
